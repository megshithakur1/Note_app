# Note_app

In this project, I worked on creating a web-app using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, API, JQuery and AJAX.<br />
The following are the main features that the app reflects. <br />
1. The user can create notes and save them by the name of the author creating the note.<br />
2. The app will count the number of notes saved. <br />
3. The app will calculate the number of characters written in the note. <br />
4. The app will be able to save the date and time of the created note.<br />
5. The users are authorized to update any note at any time, the updated info will be saved as well along with the date and time of updation.<br /> 
6. The users are allowed to delete the note any time they want.<br />

Below is the screenshot of the application. <br />
